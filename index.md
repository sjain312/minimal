# Data Enthusiast

I am currently workin as a Seniro Auditor at American Express. I have completed my Ph.D. in Economics from Shiv Nadar University, India.

## About Myself

My research interests lie in the areas of macroeconomics, international economics, and applied econometrics.  My work mainly focuses on the evolution of the manufacturing sector using the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) starting from 1983-84 and to the period 2012-13.  I have presented my work at various national and international conferences. My strength in doing research is to love playing with numbers and that helps me to handle any dataset with ease.
